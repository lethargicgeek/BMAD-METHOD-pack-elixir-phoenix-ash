      - Generate story.md to formalize given prompt
      - Generate initial requirements breakdown
   
   b. **Product Requirements Phase**
      - Run Product Owner agent
      - Create changes_for_product_requirement.md
      - Update docs/02_product_requirements/
   
   c. **Architecture Design Phase**
      - Run Architect Designer agent
      - Create changes_for_architecture_design.md
      - Update docs/03_architecture_design/
      - Generate Ash resource specifications
      - Design Phoenix components
   
   d. **Implementation Planning Phase**
      - Generate changes_for_implementation.md
      - Include:
        - Ash resource definitions
        - Phoenix context modules
        - LiveView components
        - Migration files
        - Test specifications
   
   e. **Acceptance Testing Phase**
      - Run Acceptance Tester agent
      - Create changes_for_acceptance_tests.md
      - Define manual test scenarios
      - Specify acceptance criteria
      - Generate test execution checklists

3. Update checklist_for_stories.md after each phase

4. Generate summary report

# BMAD Pack - Elixir Phoenix Ash

Create/update an expansion pack for the bmad-method called bmad-pack-elixir-phoenix-ash.

# Key Points of This Expansion

This expansion pack provides a structured approach to feature development in Elixir Phoenix applications using the Ash framework, following the BMAD methodology.

# Document Folder Structure

Folder structure pre-requisites. Create the following folders if they don't already exist:

- context_specs
  - 01_stories
    - 000001-FirstStory (incremented folder, increment for each new feature)
      - given_user_story_prompt.md (supplied by user when creating a new feature)
      - story.md (formalized story created by Feature Analyst)
      - changes_for_product_requirement.md (generated by the PO)
      - changes_for_architecture_design.md (generated by the Architect)
      - changes_for_implementation.md
      - changes_for_acceptance_tests.md
    - checklist_for_stories.md (lists all the folders in the 01_stories folder and tracks whether all its sub checklist tasks have been completed)
        - creates a sub-checklist for each story that checks off whether each of the following has been created and executed:
            - created changes_for_product_requirements.md
            - created changes_for_architecture_design.md
            - created changes_for_implementation.md
            - created changes_for_acceptance_tests.md
            - applied changes_for_product_requirements.md
            - applied changes_for_architecture_design.md
            - applied changes_for_implementation.md
            - applied changes_for_acceptance_tests.md
  - 02_product_requirements
      - Divided into folders for each feature (groups of stories)
      - Should already be sharded
  - 03_architecture_design
      - Divided into folders for each feature (groups of stories)
      - Should already be sharded
  - 04_acceptance_criteria
      - Should contain manual tests

# Task Command
- update_specifications

# Agents

## Agent Rules
- Agents should never update any files prefixed with 'given_'. These files were designed by a user. The exception is the initializer agent.

## The Agents

### 00_initializer
- Creates all the initial files in the document structure
- Sets up the base folder hierarchy
- Initializes checklist templates

### 01_feature_analyst
- Based on bmad-core/agent/analyst.md
- Looks through all the given_prompts and creates a story.md file within the story's folder to formalize the given_prompt
- Analyzes user stories and breaks them down into actionable requirements
- Creates feature checklists and tracks story dependencies

### 02_product_owner
- Based on bmad-core/agent/po.md
- Output files into the context_specs/02_product_requirements and updates the appropriate feature folder
- Translates user stories into detailed product requirements
- Ensures requirements align with business goals

### 03_architect_designer
- Based on bmad-core/agent/architect.md
- Output files into the context_specs/03_architecture_design and updates the appropriate feature folder
- Creates technical architecture documents
- Designs system components and data models
- Specifies Ash resources, actions, and policies

### 04_acceptance_tester
- Based on bmad-core/agent/qa.md
- Output files into the context_specs/04_acceptance_criteria
- Creates comprehensive manual test cases
- Defines acceptance criteria
- Ensures coverage of all user story requirements

# Commands

## /init
Creates the initial context_specs folder structure and initializes all required directories and template files.

## /execute_story_updates
For each folder, check to see if 01_stories/checklist_for_stories.md has all the story folders listed. If a folder is not listed, add it with the status of pending. A story folder is not checked off until all sub-tasks are completed.

## /execute_specs_from_stories
Updates all the documentation. Does not update code. Processes all pending stories and generates the necessary specification documents (product requirements, architecture design, implementation, and acceptance tests) based on the given user story prompts.
